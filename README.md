# Description
## A Peer Assessment System for university team projects is designed to allow students to evaluate the contributions and performance of their teammates based on four key dimensions: cooperation, conceptual contribution, practical contribution, and work ethic. The system promotes accountability and provides valuable feedback to both students and instructors on team dynamics and individual efforts.
# Features
## 1.	Students assessment:
### -Students log into the system and are prompted to evaluate each of their teammates at the end of a project or key milestones.
### -Evaluation is conducted anonymously to encourage honest and constructive feedback.
### -Students rate their peers on a 7-point scale for each of the four dimensions, along with optional comment sections for detailed feedback.
## 2. Automated Score Sharing and Anonymous Peer Feedback
### -After submission, individual scores are aggregated, and the instructor receives an overall assessment of each studentâ€™s performance.
### -Peer feedback is also shared with the students anonymously, helping them improve their performance in future projects
## 3.	Instructor Dashboard
### -Instructors have access to a dashboard that allows them to create teams, and at the end of an evaluation to show detailed peer assessment results by team, by student, and a summary of results. The results can be exported for further use as CSV file.
